# LinguisticsChat

LinguisticsChat is an advanced open-source chatbot platform tailored for individuals interested in exploring questions about the field of linguistics. It leverages the latest advancements from OpenAI's GPT-4 and a customized knowledge base to provide insightful and accurate responses. LinguisticsChat serves as a reliable resource for students, academics, and enthusiasts seeking to deepen their understanding of linguistic concepts.

## Features

- **Linguistic Expertise**: Gain insights into the field of linguistics with targeted responses from an AI trained on a specialized knowledge base.
- **Customized Knowledge Retrieval**: Uses a bespoke Vector Store from `langchain_community.vectorstores` to pull relevant information from a ChromaDB-backed persistent storage.
- **Advanced GPT-4 Interaction**: Interface with OpenAI's latest GPT-4 model for nuanced and in-depth conversation.
- **Secure Access**: Protected with a passcode to ensure controlled usage.

## How It Works

LinguisticsChat incorporates the `langchain` library to forge a powerful QA chain with a custom `ChatOpenAI` instance that utilizes OpenAI's GPT-4 model. The process involves users asking questions about linguistics, and the system intelligently retrieves knowledge from its database before generating an informed response. The chatbot is designed to simulate an expert-level conversation, drawing from both its knowledge base and the linguistic prowess of GPT-4.
